# What is the goal of this project?

This repository contains aliases for common applications.

## But why?

Remember how long it took you to learn how to extract a tar archive using the tar command?
I still need to look it up every time.

Also, often times, I find myself switching parameters for applications by mistake.

The goal of this project is to provide aliases for common applications that are easy to remember and provide a concise
user experience.
